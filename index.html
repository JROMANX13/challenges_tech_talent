        <h1>The only God</h1>
        <p>
          In Christian theology, the belief in Jesus (Yeshua) as the only God is rooted in the doctrine of the Trinity, which holds that God exists as
          three persons in one essence: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. Here are some key Bible verses that
          Christians often cite to support the belief that Jesus is divine and the only God: John 1:1, 14: "In the beginning was the Word, and the
          Word was with God, and the Word was God...

          <h2>The Messiah</h2>
          <p>
            The name "Yeshua Mashiach" translates to "Jesus the Messiah" in Hebrew. In the Bible, Jesus is referred to as the Messiah in several
            passages. Here are a few key biblical verses that highlight Jesus as the Messiah: Matthew 16:16: Simon Peter replied, "You are the
            Messiah, the Son of the living God."
          </p>
          <h2>The Son of Man</h2>
          <p>
            The title "Son of Man" is a significant one in the Bible, especially in the context of Jesus' identity and mission. It appears frequently
            in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels, and is rooted in Old Testament prophecy. Here are some key verses that refer to Jesus
            as the "Son of Man":Matthew 9:6: "'But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.' So he said to the
            paralyzed man, 'Get up, take your mat and go home.'"
          </p>
          <h2>The Alpha and the Omega</h2>
          <p>
            The titles "Alpha and Omega" are used in the Bible to signify the eternal nature and comprehensive authority of God. These titles, derived
            from the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, indicate that God encompasses all of time and existence from beginning to end. Here
            are some key Bible verses that refer to God or Jesus as the Alpha and Omega: Revelation 1:8: "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord
            God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."
